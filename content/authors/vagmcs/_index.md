I am a Ph.D. candidate and a research associate at the [Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications](http://www.iit.demokritos.gr) of the [National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”](http://www.demokritos.gr).

I work along the [CER Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr) and I conduct research mostly in the areas of machine learning and data mining under the guidance of [Dr. Georgios Paliouras](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~paliourg/) and [Dr. Alexander Artikis](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~a.artikis/). My research is currently focused on scalable semi-supervised learning of patterns for event recognition applications.

I hold a Diploma and an M.Sc. from the school of [Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.tuc.gr) at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr). During my studies I worked along the [Kouretes](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/kouretes) [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org) team where I completed my thesis "[Dynamic Multi-Robot Coordination for the RoboCup Standard Platform League](http://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/manf/16145)" under the supervision of [Michail G. Lagoudakis](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/~lagoudakis). In 2014 I joined the CER Group where I completed my master thesis "[Online Structure Learning for Markov Logic Networks using Background Knowledge Axiomatization](http://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/manf/64815)".

Apart from my research, I am fascinated by programming languages, software engineering, unix and free software.
