Hello! I work as a Data Scientist -- ML Engineer at Pollfish data team, researching and developing end-to-end AI/ML services. I have a keen interest in AI/ML theory, programming languages, and open-source.

I hold a Ph.D. in AI from the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en). My research was conducted at the [National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”](http://www.demokritos.gr) and it was mostly focused on the development of techniques for scalable semi-supervised, online learning of relational patterns for event recognition applications. During my Ph.D. and M.Sc. I was working in the [CER Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr) in sererval international research projects under the guidance of [Dr. Georgios Paliouras](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~paliourg/) and [Dr. Alexander Artikis](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~a.artikis/).

I hold a Diploma and an M.Sc. from the school of [Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.tuc.gr) at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr). During my studies I worked along the [Kouretes](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/kouretes) [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org) team where I completed my thesis "[Dynamic Multi-Robot Coordination for the RoboCup Standard Platform League](http://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/manf/16145)" under the supervision of [Michail G. Lagoudakis](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/~lagoudakis). In 2014 I joined the CER Group where I completed my master thesis "[Online Structure Learning for Markov Logic Networks using Background Knowledge Axiomatization](http://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/manf/64815)".
