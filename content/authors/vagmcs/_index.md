<!-- My primary research focus was on advancing techniques for scalable semi-supervised learning of relational patterns tailored to event recognition applications. Throughout my doctoral studies, I actively contributed to several international research projects as a member of the [CER Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr), working under the guidance of [Dr. Georgios Paliouras](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~paliourg/) and [Prof. Alexander Artikis](https://maritime-unipi.gr/en/academic_staff/artikis-alexandros/). 

I joined the CER Group in 2014 where I completed my master thesis "[Online Structure Learning for Markov Logic Networks using Background Knowledge Axiomatization](http://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/manf/64815)", focusing on the development of structure learning methods for Markov Logic Networks. Prior to my master studies, I received a Diploma from the School of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/school) at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr/en), where I had been working in the [Kouretes](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/kouretes/web) [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org) team, under the mentorship of [Prof. Michail G. Lagoudakis](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/school/faculty-and-staff/faculty?tx_tuclabspersonnel_list%5Baction%5D=person&tx_tuclabspersonnel_list%5Bcontroller%5D=List&tx_tuclabspersonnel_list%5Bperson%5D=313&cHash=25d8f2b11cad1889624a590cbb53527e). -->

Hi! I am a machine learning reasearcher deeply interested in AI/ML theory, ML for healthcare, optimization techniques, mathematical logic, and programming languages.

I hold a Ph.D. in Machine Learning, as well as an M.Sc. and a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I earned my Ph.D. from the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en), working in the group of [Dr. George Paliouras](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~paliourg/) and [Prof. Dr. Alexander Artikis](https://maritime-unipi.gr/en/academic_staff/artikis-alexandros/) in the [National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”](https://www.demokritos.gr/institute/institute-of-informatics-telecommunications) (NCSRD). My doctoral research was focused on the development of semi-supervised multi-relational learning methods for event recognition applications. I joined NCSRD in 2014, while working on my master thesis, where I actively participated in several international research projects, and contributed significantly to the development of structure learning methods for Markov Logic Networks.

My current research interests center on developing multi-modal AI models that are capable of reasoning and generalizing into out-of-distribution inputs. I firmly believe that progress in these areas is crucial, particularly for mission-critical domains such as medical and biomedical applications.
