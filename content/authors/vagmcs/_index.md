A Data Scientist at Pollfish, researching and developing end-to-end AI/ML services. I am also deeply interested in the theoretical aspects of AI/ML, optimization techniques, mathematical logic, and programming languages.

I hold a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) in collaboration with the [National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos”](http://www.demokritos.gr/en). My primary research focus was on advancing techniques for scalable semi-supervised learning of relational patterns tailored to event recognition applications. Throughout my doctoral studies, I actively contributed to several international research projects as a member of the [CER Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr), working under the guidance of [Dr. Georgios Paliouras](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~paliourg/) and [Dr. Alexander Artikis](https://maritime-unipi.gr/en/academic_staff/artikis-alexandros/). 

I joined the CER Group in 2014 where I completed my master thesis "[Online Structure Learning for Markov Logic Networks using Background Knowledge Axiomatization](http://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/manf/64815)", focusing on the development of structure learning methods for Markov Logic Networks. Prior to my master studies, I received a Diploma from the School of [Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.tuc.gr) at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr), where I have been working in the [Kouretes](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/kouretes/web) [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org) team, under the mentorship of [Prof. Michail G. Lagoudakis](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/~lagoudakis).
