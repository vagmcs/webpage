# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: We present OSLŒ± ‚Äî an online structure learner for Markov Logic Networks  (MLNs) that exploits background knowledge axiomatization in order to constrain the  space of possible structures. Many domains of interest are characterized by uncertainty and complex relational structure. MLNs is a state-of-the-art Statistical Relational Learning framework that can naturally be applied to domains governed  by these characteristics. Learning MLNs from data is challenging, as their relational structure increases the complexity of the learning process. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of many real-world applications, it is desirable to incrementally  learn or revise the model‚Äôs structure and parameters. Experimental results are  presented in activity recognition using a probabilistic variant of the Event  Calculus (MLN‚àíEC) as background knowledge and a benchmark dataset for video surveillance.
