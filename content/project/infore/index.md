INFORE is a H2020 project on extreme-scale interactive analytics and forecasting. The aim of the project is to address the challenges posed by huge datasets and pave the way for real-time, interactive, extreme-scale analytics and forecasting. Today, at an increasing rate, industrial and scientific institutions need to deal with massive data flows, streaming-in from maritime surveillance applications, financial forecasting applications or cancel cells growth simulations as well as a multitude of other sources. The ability to forecast, as early as possible, a good approximation to the outcome of a time-consuming and resource demanding computational task allows to quickly identify undesired outcomes and save a valuable amount of time, effort and computational resources.
